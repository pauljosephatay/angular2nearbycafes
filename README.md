# Nearbycafes

-	This app provides users information about nearby cafés on the chosen point on the map. The app drives the google maps places api to request for nearby cafes within 500 m radius of the given point.

-	Features of the map are: 
Dragging the pin on the map displays nearby cafes within 500m radius.
Clicking on a café icon opens a snazzy window with info about the café such as name and rating. Cafes that are very closed to each are clustered into a single marker. The marker includes a count indicating the number of cafes in that area.
